**Signals Methodology**

**Last Updated: 29 June 2020**

Signals has been created to provide greater insight into how rates evolve over time, enabling you to spot trends, analyse price evolution and make better decisions.

**Price Evolution: Track How Prices Evolve Over Time**

For both Spark25 and Spark30 contracts, **Price Evolution** allows you to:

- **Track the evolution** of every past and future delivery month assessment using Spark Forward (SparkFo), Spark Front Month (SparkF) and Spark Spot (SparkS) assessments.

- **Compare** the evolution of any two delivery month assessments as well as the **spread between months** at any point in time.

- **Check where market opinions converge and diverge** using the max and min Spark Price assessments.

**NB**: When selecting a specific calendar month, we use SparkFo and SparkF assessments to ensure that only complete months are covered.

**Price Deltas: Monitor Price Changes**

In addition to the Price Evolution chart, Price Deltas allows you to monitor the rate of price evolution and how this changes over time for any selected delivery month assessment.

**Compare Correlations: Overlay Spark Data with LNG Benchmarks**

The Compare Correlations tool allows you to overlay historical and future Spark rates with different, relevant benchmarks and data sets. This helps you to highlight trends and assess any potential relationships between LNG freight and other leading commodity indicators.

Select any or several of the following relevant LNG data sets to overlay them onto the existing Signals chart: 

* **Commodities:**

  - **Far East LNG** (price for month m+1)

  - **TTF** (price for month m)

  * **Calculations**:

    - **Cargo Arb =** FE LNG - TTF

    - **Implied Arb =** Cargo Arb - Spark rate (Spark25 or Spark30, selected by user). Spark25/30 rates are for month m and are in $/MMBtu.

* **Vessel Data (driven by the latest Kpler information):**

  * **Avg Laden Voyage Time:** For all LNG vessel, average time in days to complete last laden voyage up until release date, separated as per the following trade routes: 

    * **Atlantic-Atlantic** (loading in the Atlantic and discharging in the Atlantic)

    - **Atlantic-Pacific** (loading in the Atlantic and discharging in the Pacific)

	- **Pacific-Atlantic** (loading in the Pacific and discharging in the Atlantic)

	- **Pacific-Pacific** (loading in the Pacific and discharging in the Pacific)

  - **Laden Vessel Count:** For each release date, number of laden LNG vessels in each region: 

    * Atlantic

    - Pacific
